# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a command-line implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their markers ('X' or 'O') on the board. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- The game can be played by one player against the computer.
- The user can select their marker ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game.
- The game will display the current state of the board after each turn.
- The game will check for a winner after each turn and end the game if there is a winner.
- The game will end in a tie if there are no more available positions on the board.
